# Favorites Movie Collection
Here, everyone can create a profile where they can make a collection of their favorite movies and when they wonder what they want to watch, they can review them and like what to watch.When you search for movies you have a choice of several filters for convenience: by genre, by duration, by IMDb rating, by word in the title. You can also sort them by title, rating, duration and year. You also have the option to see general statistics for all the movies you've added.
